### Project description
Welcome to our version of a Tower Defense game built using pygame. On the playfield the player can build four different turrets. Each tower has different price, damage, range and damage per second. Your object is to kill the different enemies before they make it to the end of the path. Each wave the enemies become stronger and stronger. You have 10 lives and you lose one if an enemy make it through.

### User guide
To run the game, you need Python installed on your system. You find the latest version here at [Pythons webpage](https://www.python.org/downloads/). In addition to Python you also need to install PyGame. On Windows run `py -m pip install -U pygame --user` in your terminal and if you are on MacOS `run python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user`. Once you have Python and PyGame on your system, start the game by running `python3 main.py` in your terminal. 
GLHF!
